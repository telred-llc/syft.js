# enclaveML

EnclaveML is an experimental framework that preserves data privacy with a federating learning workflow.

[Federated learning](https://federated.withgoogle.com/) preserves data privacy by training models without needing training data needing to leave a local device. Instead of data being sent to a centralized server for training a machine learning model, the model is sent to each client to train on local data that does not need to be transmitted to a server. 


## Getting Started 

After cloning the repository, install dependencies and start the development server. 
```
npm i
npm start
```

The development server can be viewed by navigating to `localhost:3000` in a web browser.
